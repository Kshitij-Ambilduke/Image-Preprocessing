# Image-Preprocessing
This repository consists of an image prepocessing class which can perform a number of preprocessing steps. Some of methods of the class are mentioned below:
* Cropping
* RGB to GRAY
* Edge detection
* Linear Interpolation
* Nearest neighbour interpolation
* Rotation
* Median blurring 

Each of these methods were implemented from scratch using NumPy as the primary tool along with some other supporting libraries.
